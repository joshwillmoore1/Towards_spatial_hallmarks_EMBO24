# Towards Spatial Hallmarks of Cancer Detection and Treatment

This repository accompanies the poster titled 'Towards Spatial Hallmarks of Cancer Detection and Treatment' presented at EMB0 conference The Spatial Biology of Cancer 2024. The poster is a downloadable pdf from this repository.

This poster showcases two case studies using MuSpAn, a Python toolbox for Multiscale Spatial Analysis, from highlighting just two usages of muspan from explorative to hypothesis driven analysis. For more details, see www.muspan.co.uk.
